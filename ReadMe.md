## Exercise Type Prediction

### Introduction

The purpose of this work is to build a reliable way to predict movement type of people in exercise, from the data collected by their exercise trackers. The use of this work may potentially serve to suggest people to work out in good ways (safe, health and efficient) rather than bad, by analyzing their activity data.

As an "ab-initio" piece of work, the generated html report also contains codes and results from exploratory analyses of the raw data and machine learning algorithms. As anticipated, the random forest algorithm works the best, but also the longest; it's selected due to failure of all other algorithms in passing cross-validation and test.

This work is done with generous sharing from a group of enthusiast who volunteered to collect their exercise data sets. Please view the below files and publication for more information.

# Files in the Repo

This repo contains the `ExcercisePrediction`, the compiled `.html` file of the same name, and 2 folders storing graphs and cache. The neat html publication can be found on the [RPub page](http://rpubs.com/imreyes/PML_Week4).
